							<h5>1. Variance Analysis</h5>
							<img src="assets/img/ul-cost-analysis-1.JPG" class="srvimg" />
							<p>
							With this analysis, we detect and correct variances from the expected level. We analyze the causes for the variance and advise corrective actions to be taken to minimize variances. We detect the price variance (variance between actual and expected price) and volume variance (variance caused by changes in the volumes of acquired goods and services) and perform profit center and cost center analysis.

							<h5>2.	Break-even Analysis</h5>
							<img src="assets/img/ul-cost-analysis-2.JPG" class="srvimg" />
							<p>
							Our break-even analysis identifies the survival point for businesses. We measure the profit and losses at different levels of production and sales and predict the effect of alterations in sales prices. We also analyze and present the relationship between fixed and variable costs and predict the effect of changes in costs and efficiencies on profitability.

							<h5>3.	Contribution Analysis</h5>
							<img src="assets/img/ul-cost-analysis-3.JPG" class="srvimg" />
							<p>
							Here, we analyze the contribution of a product or product line to the final profit and also measure the impact of external and internal factors to the contribution. The contribution of these factors to the sales of each unit is also analyzed.

							<h5>4.	Overhead Analysis</h5>
							<img src="assets/img/ul-cost-analysis-4.JPG" class="srvimg" />
							<p>
							Here, all costs of a product's manufacture excluding material and labor costs are called overhead costs. We determine the fixed and variable overhead costs and emphasize minimizing the variable costs to maximize the profits. We also help clients monitor their variable costs regularly.
